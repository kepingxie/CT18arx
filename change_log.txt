  Nov. 11 2019 (111819_JGv1)

 Below I list those major changes made in version xxx (Sect. I to Sect. IV).

 1. The plot on kinematics of data points has been moved to the very early
 of Sect. IIA.

 2. Previous title of Sect. IIB1 was in wrong place.

 3. Previous Tables. 3-6 on chi2 of NLO fits is removed now to keep only
 the main stream of NNLO fits.

 4. Sect. IIIA3 on top-quark production, I would rather keep a few
 representative plots on pT_t, m_tt and y_t only. Some descriptions
 are added.

 5. Captions on previous figure of d/u ratio are largely modified.

 6. The title of Sect.IV B has been changed to for alpha_s only
 since I did not see any discussions on m_c and Q_0.

 7. Discussions on lumonisities have been added into Sect.IV C. 

 Other questions or modifications I am not able to accomendate.

 1. On the left plot of Fig. 3 on the x-dependence scale, just to make
 sure the PDF is not CT18X but some intermediate fit, right?

 2. In talbes 4 and 5 on the calculation programs and scales, format of
 the two tables are different, also not sure about the distincetions
 between them.

 3. Also to confirm in Fig. 10, those are intermediate fits, right? We
 might need to change the labels.

 4. Related to the d/u ratio plot, we talk about the smalless of the
 CJ15 uncertainty, which tolerence is used in that CJ15 plot?

 5. In Sect.IV B on alphas, the discussion on NLO fits are incomplete.
 Also the NLO LM scan plot is missing. Besides, Fig. 18 is very hard to
 read. Also no discussions are accompanied.

 6. At the end of Sect.IV A, the discussion on strangeness parametrization
 was not clear and incomplete (we may also want to put that as an independent
 subsection).

 7. In table. 6 it was not explained why there is a missing element for NNPDF,
 also applied to Fig. 21.
